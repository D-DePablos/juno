title: Feeder Gateway Middleware
description: Api exposed from the node.
---

We have plans to expose an API to become middleware between apps and the StarkNet Feeder Gateway. The goal is that
any app should be able to connect directly to the juno node and fetch locally stored information or, in
the worst case scenario, fetch information from the feeder gateway.

To make this possible, we implemented the [Feeder Gateway Client](../features/feeder-gateway.mdx).
