The config file for `Juno` represent all the vars needed for handle all the functionalities that are supported on the
node execution.

This is the basic struct:
```yaml
ethereum:
  node: "you_node_here"
rpc:
  enabled: false
  port: 8080
rest:
  enabled: false
  port: 8100
  prefix: /feeder_gateway
metrics:
  enabled: true
  port: 8100
db_path: /path/to/database
starknet:
  enabled: true
  feeder_gateway: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io
  api_sync: true
  network: mainnet
```

## Params

### ethereum

Represent the configuration for the Ethereum node.

- `node`: you should put the direction to an archive node, for example, an Infura archive node.

### rpc

Represent the configuration for the RPC server.

- `enabled`: Represent if the RPC server is enabled.
- `port`: Represent the node in which the RPC server is going to be served.

### rest

Represent the configuration for the REST server that handle all the feeder_gateway like http requests.

- `enabled`: Represent if the REST server is enabled.
- `port`: Represent the node in which the REST server is going to be served.
- `prefix`: Represent the prefix of the service, in this case should be: `node_ip:port/feeder_gateway`.

### metrics

Represent the configuration for the Prometheus metrics.

- `enabled`: Represent if the metrics are enabled.
- `port`: Represent the node in which the metrics are going to be served.

### db_path

Represent the path in which the data of the node is going to be saved.

### starknet

Represent the configuration for the StarkNet network and sync details.

- `enabled`: Represent if the REST server is enabled.
- `feeder_gateway`: Represent the StarkNet endpoint that we are going to connect, should be from another `Juno` node or
from the feeder gateway, that defines mainnet or goerli, if `enabled` starknet, always needed.
- `api_sync`: Represent if we are going to perform a synchronization using the Feeder Gateway, or we are going to sync
against Layer 1.
- `network`: Used in case you don't have an ethereum node and want to do an API sync. By default, `mainnet` is the
value, anything else will be considered as goerli. Not needed if you aren't running an API sync.
